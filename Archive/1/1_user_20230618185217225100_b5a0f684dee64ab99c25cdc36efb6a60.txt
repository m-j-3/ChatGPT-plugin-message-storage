That's awesome! "House of Anubis" indeed did a great job of incorporating elements of Egyptian mythology into its storyline. The characters Ra, Isis, and Anubis are central figures in Egyptian mythology. Ra is the sun god and one of the most important gods in ancient Egypt. Isis, the goddess of magic and wisdom, is known for her role in the story of Osiris, where she resurrects him after he is killed by Set. Anubis, the god of mummification and the afterlife, is often depicted as a man with the head of a jackal. These myths and deities have such rich histories and stories associated with them. If you have any specific questions or if there's a particular aspect of these mythologies you'd like to explore further, feel free to let me know!
